Colemak-DH keyboard layout for OSX. This is the ANSI,full,  no ergo-mods version.
All of the standard Alt-gr keys are mapped to the placement of the Coleman character (´ is under the Colemak e) 

## Install 
To install, copy the Colemak-DH-ansi.bundle folder to either
~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts 
or 
/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts

The bundle includes both the standard layout and a DH version of the ABC Extended QWERTY layout that comes with OS X

It doesn’t take admin privileges to install in ~/Library, but OS X will revert
back to QWERTY every time you type in a password. 

## To customize
Download a copy of the SIL.org Ukelele tool from http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele. 
You should be able to open the bundle and start editing.
